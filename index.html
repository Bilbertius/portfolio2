    <p id="about-card" class="card">

      I am still trying to get a handle on that question myself, but for the sake of brevity, I'll say that I am a former smart home technician and current burgeoning web developer,
      music addict, and life long learner stuck on a perpetually looping treadmill of curiosity. Teaming up with great programmers to solve various problems is an excellent way to satisfy my
      curious nature while producing interesting and useful solutions that anyone can benefit from.
      <br><br>

      Originally from the great big state of Vermont, I now call Colorado home. Outside of the digital world my interests include
      art, reading, cooking, music, philosophy, psychology, politics, camping, writing, travel, hiking, and giving dogs too much attention.

    <h2>my skills</h2>

    <p id='skills-card' class="card">
      My technical skills include proficiency in HTML, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+)
      with knowledge of and experience with Semantic HTML, RESTful APIs,
      Bootstrap, ExpressJS, PostgreSQL, React, Git, Responsive Design,
      and svelte 3. Also, I am comfortable with prototyping and wireframing
      tools such as Figma, Sketch, Framer, inVision and Adobe XD.<br><br>

      I'm always looking to add to this ever-growing list, so if you have a project in mind,
      and you think my services could be of use don't allow this to limit your idea of what I
      can do or what I am willing to learn.

    >
      Jamcloud was built to help fans of improv-centric music (often called 'jam band music') to track and share their favorite live recordings.
      I built it because I know all to well the massive task it is to try to accomplish this without help.
      Plans to add the ability for users' to share lists with friends as well as rate other users choices and see how their favorites stack up
      against a list comprised of jams with the highest average ratings. It was build using React, ExpressJS, and PostgreSQL.

      Try-lingual is an app that was built for students of foreign languages to help them learn and retain vocabulary. It utilizes spaced repetition to ensure the user is being quizzed on words it struggles with more frequently than those words which they find less challenging. The ultimate goal is to assist users in effectively and efficiently committing foreign vocab to memory. This app was built with React, ExpressJS, and PostgreSQL.

      This app was built for anyone who has ever felt unsure of what to do with excess free time on their hands. It allows users to generate a random choice from a pool of all activities that have been submitted by other users. The user can decline activities until they see a choice that they like. Users can also narrow down the possible activities by selecting a category they wish for their activity to fall under. The user can also consult a list of previous activities that they have accepted as well as a global list of activities most commonly selected by other users. This app was built with React, ExpressJS, and PostgreSQL.
